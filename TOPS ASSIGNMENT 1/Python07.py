# HOW MEMORY IS MANAGED IN PYTHON ?

""" 
There are two ways to manage memory in python

1) Dynamic Allocation :
      As the program progresses it allocates and re-locates memory and making it possible to re-use it.
      
2) Static Allocation : 
      Memory is pre-determined and it can not be re-used.
