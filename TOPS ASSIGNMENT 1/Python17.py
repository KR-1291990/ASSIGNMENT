# WHAT ARE THE NEGATIVE INDEXES AND WHY THEY ARE USED IN PYTHON ?

"""
Negative indexing is a process of assigning negative numbers from the end towards begining of a sequence.
It allows us to access elements of a sequence from the end. This can be helpful for getting a last few elements of a sequence or reversing a sequence.
