# WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF "CONTINUE STATEMENT " IN PYTHON ?

"""
The CONTINUE STATEMENT is used in loop when we want to skip a certain type of occurances and contiue the loop.

For example in a manufacturing unit when we want to reject/discard defective pieces of a product and continue the production.
